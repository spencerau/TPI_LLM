**Competitive Integrated Employment (CIE):** Preparing youth and adults for CIE and careers, starts well before age 16. As individuals with disabilities, families, school staff and community agencies focus on transition planning, employment and career development, there is an expectation that employment options will be available. It is our responsibility in the schools, in the community and at home to promote and support the acquisition of skills that will prepare our youth/adults to secure and retain jobs that are competitive and integrated. The following chart identifies the skills specific to the environments where individuals learn the skills needed for success in the workplace and life.

**Accommodations & Modifications:** Supports and aids are frequently provided in educational, employment and community settings to enable individuals to have optimum success. The importance of identifying, documenting and utilizing needed accommodations cannot be overstated. As youth/adults enter the workplace, reasonable accommodations can be requested. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the federal law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in the workplace. When needed, accommodations are negotiated with the employer and are specific to the individual work site and individual employee. It is our responsibility to prepare individuals with disabilities, starting at an early age, for the workplace (work training & employment) of the present and future.

**Directions:** This chart is divided into (4) columns including: **Workplace, School, Community & Home Domains.**

- The skills listed under the Workplace column have been verified by business representatives as skills needed for successful employment.

- Families, school staff and community members all have an important role in helping youth/adults learn expected behaviors.

- The Community Domain applies to skill development supported by all service providers, educators and family members.

- Tracking progress will help to identify training needs and will assist in better preparing youth for positive work experiences with the goal of

- The School, Community & Home Columns include activities that will promote employment related skill development.

- As you work with your youth/adults, please be mindful that the identified skills listed under the School, Community and Home domains will support the development of employability skills.

- Collect baseline data on the form and then rate the individual on a monthly/quarterly basis.

- Additionally, the development of these skills will enhance the youth's social life, community participation and the option to attend and<table><tr><td>participating in paid employment and eventually obtaining economic self-sufficiency.</td><td>successfully complete post-secondary training and education opportunities as an adult.</td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>To start, you are encouraged to identify and work on a small number of skills, record date completed and move to developing additional skills as ready and appropriate.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>The skills listed in this chart can be a focus for development in children pre-school through adulthood.</li></ul></td></tr></table>

#### Notes:

1. Person Centered/Driven Planning (PCP/PDP) should be used to develop a plan to ensure buy-in and commitment to the process of promoting positive lifestyle outcomes. The student, family, school staff, community agency reps and other invited guests work together to identify student preferences, future expectations, action steps in the areas of education, employment, independent living, transportation, health and fitness, as well as recreation. This planning process can lay the groundwork for effective plan development including Education's Individual Education Plans (IEPs) & Individual Transition Plans (ITPs), Individual Program Plan (IPP) with the Regional Center and Individual Plan for Employment (IPE) with Department of Rehabilitation (DOR).
2. The student, school staff and parents should work together to develop meaningful Individual Education Plans (IEPs) and Individual Transition Plans (ITPs) that support participation in work experience and integrated competitive employment.
3. Identifying appropriate accommodations for both academic and employment settings is critical to short- and long-term success.
4. Learning about Social Security Administration (SSA) Benefits Planning & Management is an essential strategy to support long term, Competitive Integrated Employment (CIE). This includes learning about SSA Work Incentives, i.e.: Student Earned Income Exclusion (SEIE), Impairment Related Work Expenses (IRWE), Expedited Reinstatement (EXR), etc.
5. Ongoing job supports & follow-up services must be identified, monitored, evaluated and consistently applied to ensure long term job retention.
6. CIE is essential to providing quality of life for individuals with all disabilities, including those with significant cognitive disabilities and complex support needs.
