- The role of the job skills trainer/job coach: do's and don'ts.# Job Skills Trainer/Job Coach

Definition: A Job Coach provides specialized on-site training to employees with disabilities. May be assigned a wide variety of duties and functions, but there are two clear areas of responsibility:

- Assist the person to learn to perform job tasks accurately, efficiently and safely,
- Assist the person to integrate/acclimate into the work environment and culture.# What does a Job Skills Trainer/Job Coach do?

- Perform a job task analysis.
- Provide one-on-one training on a job site.
- Communicate with the employer about performance and further training needs if necessary.
- Decrease involvement over time - as the employee masters the requirements of the position, the job coach will then contact the employee and supervisor on an as-needed basis.# Who is the ideal Job Skills Trainer/Job Coach?

- Believes anyone can work when given the right support(s).
- Knows instructional techniques to teach job tasks.
- Communicates effectively.
- Effectively handles a variety of often difficult situations.
- Is conscious of ethical issues in decision-making during delivery of services.# People First Language

- Eliminates generalizations, assumptions and stereotypes.
- Focuses on the person, rather than the disability.
- Some people may not use preferred terminology. It is important you do.
- Do not repeat negative terms that stereotype, devalue or discriminate.# People First Language

Say....

- People with disabilities
- A person who is blind, people who have a visual impairment
- Accessible parking/hotel, etc.
- She has a physical disability or Jane uses a chair.

Not....

- The disabled or handicapped
- The blind person or blind people
- Handicapped parking – hotel room, etc.
- She's wheelchair bound or She's confined to a chair.# Communication

- Individuals sharing thoughts, ideas and purpose.
- Listening, writing, body language, electronic messages
- Important in Job Coaching!
  - Model positive appropriate techniques
  - Eliminate stereotypes
  - Promote acceptance# Communication

- Style
  - Formal vs Informal
  - Direct vs Indirect (or Serious vs Humorous)
  - Sensitive to culture
  - Positive vs Negative

Know the person you are working with!!# Communication

- Words you Say

– Attacking – “If you were doing your job...”

– Preaching – “You don’t understand...”

– Power/Threatening – “If you don’t...”

Remedy with using “I”

“I feel as if...”

“My expectation is...”

“I’m not sure...”# Communication

- Non-verbal
  - Paralanguage – tone, inflection, speed, pitch
  - Body language – arms crossed, thumbs up/down, nodding, moving slowly, fidgeting
  - Facial expressions smile, rolling eyes, raising eyebrows, avoiding eye contact,# Communication

- Active Listening
  - Understanding, interpret and evaluate the message
- Reflective Listening
  - Restating in your own words what the speaker has said
- Ask open ended questions (who, what, where, when, why)# Ethics/Confidentiality

- Disclosure – revealing information about one's disability.
  - Employer may not ask questions designed to elicit information about a disability
  - Person chooses to disclose or not
  - Job Coach may not disclose unless given authority by the person with the disability# Ethics

- Considerations for Job Coaches
  - Aware
  - Trust
  - Providing information to others
  - Developing a script# Values

- All people can work given appropriate supports.
- Severity of disability is not a determining factor of whether a person is employable or capable of learning.
- Support must be individualized.
- The process to obtain employment for persons with disabilities is the same as for their non-disabled counterparts.
- Employment is defined as non-special; that is, community-based and competitive as it is for everyone else.# Values

- Competitive Integrated Employment
  - Regular non-segregated setting
  - Wages & Benefits – same as others workers doing the same job
  - Co-workers without a disability## Common Issues – Don'ts

- Dependency on the job coach may result in low retention
- Differentiates the employee from coworkers
- Does not resemble natural employment
- Working with the job coach reduces social interaction with coworkers
- Job coach moves into a coworker role## Keep in Mind – Do's

- The employee is the focus.
- Independence is the goal.
- Self advocacy +
- Employer is a customer and expert on their work place.
- The Job Coach brings knowledge of the worker and disability accommodations.![White line drawing of the clock tower of the University of North Texas.](7678f0d0c562ecbcc690eb9f55f43120_1_img.webp)

# Job and Task Analysis

UNT®  
UNIVERSITY  
OF NORTH TEXAS®

EST. 1890# Job Analysis

- Defined by TWC-VRD as breaking a position into its parts and identifying the inherent requirements.
- Demonstrates what the candidate can do, where support is needed and provides solutions for any part of a job that a candidate is unable to perform..
- Study of a job at the workplace.# Individualized Job Analysis

**Different** audiences require  
**different** instructional strategies;  
**different** contexts demand  
**different** job task analysis methods.

Jonassen, et al., (1999)# Benefits of a Job Analysis

- Examines the tasks the employee performs, resulting in greater attention to detail.
- Recognizes the importance of natural supports, such as supervisors and co-workers, as well as the workplace culture and environment.
- Answers the questions about a job to ensure the placement meets the interest, preferences, employment conditions and functional job tasks for the consumer.

*Poor job retention rates have been linked to the lack of proper job analysis and poor quality job match.*# Job Analysis Basics

Rough outline of what is required by an employee to perform the job

- Critical job tasks
- Infrequent job tasks
- Social response (workplace culture)
- Related non-work issues such as
  - Grooming, transportation, lunchtime needs, etc.
- Where the job is done# Job Analysis

- Must be done by actually experiencing the job being performed.
- Needs to identify the critical “un-spoken” demands of the job
  - For example:
    - What would get someone fired?# Job Description

- May help identify critical elements
  - Which gets the most time?
  - Which might give your client trouble?
  - How do you address those “trouble” areas?# Job Description

- Does not help to see job culture
- Does not identify social interactions
- Does not tell you how to get fired or how not to get fired
- Does not tell you that you have to like football to work there# Job Analysis

1. Determine sequence of duties
2. Task analyze skills-each duty
3. Identify and describe the tools, skills, and equipment needed
4. Talk with supervisor and co-workers
5. Observe co-workers
6. Try to complete the job duties
7. Develop a training/teaching plan# Job Analysis

- Leads to the development of the training considerations or plan to support the employee during the initial training period.
- Training considerations, and plan you create, addresses skill development, work routines, and integration with co-workers.# Job Analysis

- Good job analyses are translated into small task analyses, AND...
- All this leads to a coaching plan# What is Task Analysis?

- Task Analysis: shows how a task is accomplished, including a details of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, and necessary clothing and equipment.# Task Analysis

1. Meet with the Employer
2. Meet with Coworkers and Supervisors
3. Observe the job
4. Take photos or video tasks# Four Aspects of a Task Analysis

**Task** Learn specific information about the job and the steps involved in getting the job done to the employer's satisfaction. Look at the natural way the job is completed.

**Timing** What is the natural time for the job to be done and how long does it usually take? Is there a sequence for how the job is completed or is someone else waiting for you to complete your part? Is there a quota expectation from the employer?

**Tools** What tools do people typically use to do the job including equipment, supplies, reminders, etc? Are all the tools manageable and readily available?

**Teachable Steps** Contains information matched to the needs of the employee and those areas that should be emphasized for job training.# Task Analysis Strategies

1. Obtain a skill list from the employer of a detailed description already developed or used by other employees.
2. Perform the job and record data.
3. Observe another employee completing the tasks and write down the steps as the job is performed.
4. Develop the Task Analysis with the individual present, observing another employee completing the tasks.
5. Observe the individual at the job site, to determine what the individual may readily perform, as well as their observation of the desired level of work.

*Remember that the employer is the final expert on how the task should be accomplished. If the process or result do not meet the employer's expectation, a job may be lost.*# Modify a Task

- If the consumer has difficulty with certain steps, those can be broken down or modified to facilitate learning.
- Initially, tasks should be broken down into only as many steps as needed by an average employee in that setting.
- This creates the 'least effort' scenario and the employer and other natural personnel relate to the process. It also saves time and money for the provider.# Modifying a Task

## Natural Job Task Breakdown

- Answer Phone.
- Check-in members.
- "Walk" the cardio room.
- Wipe down machines after use.
- Vacuum lobby floor.

## Adapted Job Task Breakdown

- Answer Phone.
- Check-in members.
  - Greet member.
  - Swipe membership card.
  - Offer towel.
  - Trade car keys for towel.
  - Hang keys by last name of member.
- "Walk" the cardio room.
- Wipe down machines after use.
- Vacuum lobby floor.# Types of Job Tasks

- **Core Routines**- Typically those most frequently performed by employee in repeating cycles without significant interruption between
- **Episodic Routines**- Job tasks that occur infrequently; once or twice a shift or week
- **Job Related Routines** – Skills and routines that are not part of the job but are vital to successful performance# Task Analysis

Job Training  
TechniquesJob Training

WHAT IS THE  
GOAL?# Teaching Process

1. Job task is clearly understood
2. Employee achieves proficiency - he/she can complete the job task correctly
3. Performance is reinforced# How we learn

## Phases of Learning

- Acquisition
- Fluency
- Maintenance
- Generalization# Training

![Illustration of a person in blue reaching up, with a large hand reaching down to help them climb over a ledge.](01ca9aae6eded0282e4b36d6b05be206_2_img.webp)

- Individualized training techniques matches the employee's learning style
  - – visual, auditory, kinesthetic, chaining
- Design training to use least intrusive method
- Provide a balance between the natural techniques used and what is most effective for the employee# Common Training Strategies

1. Natural Cues
2. Prompts
   1. Direct Verbal Prompts
   2. Indirect Verbal Prompts
   3. Non-Verbal Prompts
3. Modeling
4. Physical Assistance
5. Reinforcement
6. Self-instruction techniques# Natural Cues

- Movement in the workplace:
  - Buzzers/alarms/switches
  - Other workers' movement; routines
  - Change in machinery operation
- Supervisor & coworker communication tools
  - Verbal
  - Email
  - Posted information or verbal announcements
- Personal calendar with reminders
  - Electronic or smart phone# Verbal Prompts

- Spoken or signed instruction
- Useful before, during and after task is demonstrated
- Helpful for teaching order or discrimination tasks
- Not manipulation skills (requires practice)
- Avoid information overload - watch pace
- Caution: employee may attend to trainer instead of task# Indirect Verbal Prompt

<table><thead><tr><th>Cue</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>"Next"</td><td>What's next in the sequence, or move on to the next one.</td></tr><tr><td>"Time"</td><td>Check your time - are you on schedule?</td></tr><tr><td>"Again" or "Repeat"</td><td>Repeat the same action.</td></tr></tbody></table># Nonverbal Prompts & Gestures

- Gestures such as pointing and mimicking a motion used in a job task - not appropriate if consumer is visually impaired
- Minimizes employee distraction from task
- Helpful if there are language barriers
- Organize the workspace materials or equipment in a manner that the workflow presents itself without any other prompt.# Nonverbal Prompts & Gestures

<table><thead><tr><th>Cue</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Point to time clock</td><td>Punch in or out</td></tr><tr><td>Tap wrist watch</td><td>Stay on time, break time or finish up</td></tr><tr><td>Touch safety glasses or point to eyes</td><td>Put on safety glasses</td></tr><tr><td>Point to object &amp; shake head "no"</td><td>Not this one, leave this alone</td></tr></tbody></table># Modeling

- A natural teaching approach that simulates the activity
- Evoles a mimic response
- Combines demonstration by trainer with simultaneous performance by the employee
- Trainer shows pace and complex manipulations
- Maintains productivity
- *The person demonstrating the task must provide accurate information*## Side-by-Side Modeling

- More difficult for trainer to catch errors
- Not as effective for employees who need close attention
- Caution trainer is not considered an ongoing support for production
- Consider a coworker as the ‘model’ for the employee so that you can coach from a training perspective# Physical Assistance

- Touching or physically guiding the employee through some or all steps in the task cycle
- Most effective on manipulation steps and tasks
- Partial Assist
- Hand-over-hand
- Most intrusive of the strategies# Reinforcement

- Personal
- Social reward
- Recognition that the employee recognizes as positive
- Workplace positive & negative reinforcements
- Paycheck# Self Management

- Why Teach Self-management?

- Many individuals with disabilities experience difficulties because they fail to respond appropriately and independently to changing circumstances in their job.
- Individuals with disabilities often rely on their instructors to manage their skill instruction and behavior# Self-Management Strategies

- Teach the learner to understand how to self-instruct: Use each of these steps while teaching a job task. Then, you are also teaching a learning process. Once a person learns how to self-instruct, they can generalize the process when challenged with new tasks.

1. The trainer models a task while the learner observes.
2. The learner performs the task while the trainer verbalizes the task.
3. The learner again performs the task but verbalizes the instructions himself/herself.
4. The learner performs the task while whispering the self-instructions.
5. The learner performs the task and self-instructs performing the task.# Self Management

Individualized approach where the worker begins to manage their own behavior. This involves using cues and techniques the worker enjoys and can manage.

Unobtrusive & Personal

Flow chart, picture booklet, memory notebook, verbal labels, audio# Compensatory Skills

- Adaptions or modifications
  - To the workplace
  - The job task
  - Or, a part of the job process
- Increases employee's control of the job task# Accommodations

"any change or adjustment to a job, the work environment, or the way things usually are done that would allow an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform job functions, or enjoy equal access to benefits available to other individuals in the workplace."

ODEP (Office of Disability Employment Policy)# Productivity Enhancers

- Physical Changes
- Accessible and assistive Technologies
- Accessible communications
- Policy changes or modifications![Stylized white outline of the University of North Texas clock tower against a dark green background.](c0565919e74a229ff3cb56194da9e0c6_1_img.webp)

Natural Supports

UNT®  
UNIVERSITY  
OF NORTH TEXAS®

EST. 1890# Natural Supports

- Any naturally occurring assistance, relationships and interactions that allow a person to secure, maintain and advance in a community job of their choosing.
- The goal is to assist with job retention.
- Some may need a combination of natural supports and other supports# Types of Natural Supports

- Organizational supports
- Physical supports
- Social supports
- Training supports
- Service supports
- Community supports
- Family/personal supports# Learning Natural Ways

- Identify the unique features of the **culture** of the work setting.
- Gain a clear image of the **ways** in which people perform their jobs, their interactions, the management style.
- Carefully observe **specific tasks** which comprise the supported employee's job.
- **Task Analysis** should fit employee's learning style.# Let's Talk About Culture

- Knowing the work culture can help with the right job fit.
- Understanding culture can help identify training issues for inclusion (break time customs).
- Culture helps you gauge the potential for advancement in the job or movement to another job.
- People who are “a part” of their workforce tend to be more successful.# Elements of Workplace Culture

![Illustration of a warehouse worker operating a forklift, viewed from above, suggesting a large industrial workplace.](bf42b53439e7b43473bb63200f074d1e_2_img.webp)

- The first step is to define the work place
- This can vary, depending on the size of the company

![Illustration of a small, two-story building labeled 'café' with people sitting outside, representing a small business or different type of workplace.](bf42b53439e7b43473bb63200f074d1e_4_img.webp)# Key Element – Joint tasks

- Relationships form and interactions take place when people perform tasks together
- Inclusion is enhanced
- Not everyone wants to “connect”
- Learning the “natural method” is important# Key Element - Shared Tasks

- Are there certain tasks that almost everyone does? (Carry bags for customers, deliver supplies, answer phones)
- Workers can compare notes – share stories and have a common bond
- Look at work flow to find shared tasks
- The person must be able to communicate about the tasks – one way is using the “props” of the task# Key Element - Co-Worker Help

- Availability and proximity of assistance if a worker needs it
- Mutual but not necessarily equal
- Some work cultures view need for assistance as a weakness
- Some jobs performed in isolation
- Show the person where to get help rather than helping them
- Don't deputize co-workers as Job coaches
- Teach Employees how/when to offer help# Key Element - Work Schedule and Social Times

- Does the person work the same schedule as co-workers
- Carpooling considered when other transportation
- Are there “valleys” or slowdowns when socialization occurs
- Place and time people “hang out” - be mindful of social customs and “rules”## Key Element - Mealtimes

- Meal customs vary from location to location-
- May occur occasionally as special event or part of ritual (Holidays or Payday)
- Interactions? Bring lunch? Buy Lunch?
- Ensuring person has resources# Key Elements - Special Terms and Jargon

- Distinctive terms of language that identify users as “members”
- Humorous names...“ordering cat”
- Model for employee using the terms used by the employer# Building Support

- Invite a co-worker to introduce the new employee to others
- Assist the new employee in joining company events
- Learn the language of the job and help the new employee learn it
- Assist the new employee to show respect for the work space and boundaries of others
- Help the new employee identify the leadership
- Others?# Strategies for Support

- Must develop long-term (ongoing) supports
  - Natural supports/process
  - Chart to measure progress and enhance performance
  - Facilitated by JST/Job Coaches
  - Plan for exit of the JST/Job Coach# The Balancing Act

- Job coaches need to support natural procedures and relationships whenever feasible...but step in when necessary, and teach skills or offer assistance.
- There are things the job coach can never do, as well as the “natural” people on job sites--they serve a secondary, back-up role.# Natural Support: Goals

- Match with the individual's preferences, needs and work culture
- Ensure safety, health and well-being of the individual# Problem Solving

- Each change from “natural procedures” should proceed in a most natural to least natural manner.
- Offer suggestions to the employer but invite their ideas as well; they are the expert in relation to their workplace.# Intervention Decision Pyramid

How can you assist with the problem while helping to build employer/employee capacity?

Does the Employer have a solution in mind?

Is this a skill, knowledge or motivation problem?

How Urgent is the situation?

What Type of Assistance is the Employer Seeking  
From You?

What Has Changed?# Support

Jim has a job rolling silverware at Rudy's. He mastered the task. However, when the job coach was not present, the employer noticed that Jim's pace slowed dramatically. The employer concern was lack of productivity.

**How should the job coach respond?**# Role Responsibilities

Employer calls you, the Job Coach, aside and says, “I’m concerned about his performance...it doesn’t appear to be up to standard.”

How should the job coach respond?# Relationships

Your client advises he no longer wants to participate in the summer work program. He has worked for 3 weeks without incident and had indicated he enjoys his job.

What should the job coach do?# Do's and Don'ts with Troubleshooting

## DO

- Involve the employer
- Listen with concern
- Encourage strengths
- Least intrusive method
- Involve the consumer
- Creatively Go to Plan B
- Fact finding 'First'

## DO NOT

- Forget the Family
- Solve in isolation
- Accept the 1st impression
- Assume
- Allow the behavior to rule
- Forget the profile
- Focus on consequence
